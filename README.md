## Overview
The **Amazon Sales Report** dashboard provides a comprehensive view of Amazon's sales performance across various product categories and time periods. Built using **Power BI** with a dataset in **Excel**, the dashboard enables a detailed analysis of sales trends, top-performing products, customer preferences, and inventory requirements to drive data-driven decisions.

## Problem Statement
Amazon seeks to understand its sales dynamics better by:
- Analyzing sales performance across different product categories and time periods.
- Identifying top-performing products and understanding customer preferences.
- Optimizing inventory management to maximize revenue and profitability.

The goal of this dashboard is to provide insights that address these questions, enabling Amazon to make informed decisions that enhance revenue, improve profitability, and reinforce its market leadership.

## Solution
This Power BI dashboard presents a clear, visually appealing report that covers:
- **Sales by Month** and **Sales by Week**: Visualizes monthly and weekly sales trends, highlighting seasonal patterns and high-performing periods.
- **Sales Metrics**: Key performance indicators (KPIs) like **Year-to-Date (YTD) Sales**, **Quarter-to-Date (QTD) Sales**, **YTD Products Sold**, and **YTD Reviews** offer a snapshot of Amazon’s current performance.
- **Product Category Breakdown**: Shows YTD and QTD sales across categories such as *Men’s Shoes*, *Cameras*, and *Toys*, helping in identifying which categories are driving the most revenue.
- **Top Products** and **Product Reviews**: Highlights the best-selling products and those with the highest customer engagement, offering insights into customer preferences and potential inventory priorities.

The dashboard background was custom-designed using **Figma**, ensuring an intuitive and visually engaging experience.
